In my opinion the entirety is structured in a clear and modular way. The existence of all operations
and attributes is justifiable which is not always self-evident.

About everything in the UML-table is related to the contents of this course in some way. Inheritance,
interface implementations and multi interface implementations especially. One thing that stands out
the most is maybe implementation of the enum class. I don't know why such a simple construction
is so hard for me to take as a part of my coding. It's implementation in checking if a tool is compatible
with a given metal is great.
